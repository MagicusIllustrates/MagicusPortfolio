<h3>festival of the sun and sea</h3>
</header>
<p>
A personal illustration made by my passion for brightness and life. I personally <b>love</b> things that focus on movement, happiness, and lively simple things that happen in my hometown. I still remember those days when I would randomly pass by or see a parade at every festival near my home.

<h3>Witch Dinner</h3>
<p>
A pretty normal Idea about a witch getting too hungry to the point where she captures the mouse that has been living in her home for centuries and makes some rat soup, but that wasn't until it was saved by the witch's sacrifice who bought her a fast food meal.

<h3>Fishing</h3>
<p>
In this illustration, I experimented with a new coloring style, and in the summer I had my first "summer house" experience in Finland. there I experienced Fishing, boat rides, and being on an island owned by well-off step-grandparents. so I used that experience for this "experiment illustration".
