<h3>Cultist</h3>
<p>
a character design for <b>Origin Of Power</b> the description given, <b>Cultist, for more evil inclined or occult adventurers. able to sacrifice people or creatures to create powerful effects. cultists unlock a small pool of spells, even if they are warriors</b>
<p>
to be honest, (personal opinion)at first it was cool but I could've done better. but it was already sold, put out, and shown by my employer so, oh well.

<h3>Casey's house</h3>
<p>
This is the house of the main character for my personal project, a comic called <b>The Best Orphanage.</b> This
design is inspired by my grandmother's place but also with a little bit of imagination. Casey is a 30-year-old woman who lives in a very tiny house fit for only 1 person with her beloved garden just right next to it.

<h3>Casey full reference design</h3>
<p>
Casey has a very simple design, she is one of the main characters in <b>The Best Orphanage</b>. her design is inspired by my favorite dress but in a different color. she is also inspired by my admiration for strong-minded women, and this is how I picture that description and personality.

<h3>Old man turnaround design</h3>
<p>
One of the main characters in my personal comic <b>The Best Orphanage</b>. is the caretaker for the orphanage that takes care of the most rare and mysterious individuals on earth. his design is just what I picture an orphanage caretaker would look like in a fantasy setting. with his robes and his headband that describe the sunset and tides.

<p>
Pikku is one of the main villains in <b>The Best Orphanage</b> he is a shut-in so it explains his simple and plain design, with an expression that presents his dull and awkward attitude.
</p>
